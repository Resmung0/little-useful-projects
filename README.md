The projects stored here use the [inline script method](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/) supported after version 3.11 of Python.
Besides, I use [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/) to manage the dependencies from each project.
You can know more about how to use this approach [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/).

# Usage

Before using any project, you have to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Resmung0/little-useful-projects.git
```

Than, choose a project and run the followed command:

```python
uv run name_of_the_project.py
```

Each project have it's specific parameters to customize their behaviour. So, check out the wiki page for each one of them.
